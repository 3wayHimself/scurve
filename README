A collection of algorithms and visualisation tools related to space-filling
curves.


The tools included are:

    colorswatch: Creates a swatch with a visual breakdown of the colours
    contained in a specified image.

    cube: Outputs a POV-Ray definition file for drawing 3-dimensional curves.

    drawcurve: Generates two dimensional lines-and-vertexes drawings of
    space-filling curves.

    gray: Prints a bit representation of the Gray codes of a specified bit
    width.

    testpattern: Projects a 3-dimensional traversal of the RGB colour cube onto
    a specified two-dimensional curve.
